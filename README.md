## About Shasta
The goal of Shasta is to rapidly produce accurate assembled sequence using as input DNA reads generated by [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com) flow cells.

Computational methods used by the Shasta assembler include:

- Using a [run-length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) representation of the read sequence. This makes the assembly process more resilient to errors in homopolymer repeat counts, which are the most common type of errors in Oxford Nanopore reads.
- Using in some phases of the computation a representation of the read sequence based on markers, a fixed subset of short k-mers (k â‰ˆ 10).
