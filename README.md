2. Create an input directory on [dashboard](https://console.latch.bio/data) and upload your data
3. Add `wf.shasta` to your workspace from [explore](https://console.latch.bio/explore)
4. Go to your [workflows](https://console.latch.bio/workflows) and open `wf.shasta` tool
5. Provide the input directory where `fasta` file is uploaded and also select the `conf` file
6. Launch the workflow
